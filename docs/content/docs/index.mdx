description: Get started with gill, the new JavaScript client for Solana developers.
---

Gill is a modern javascript/typescript client library for interacting with the
[Solana](http://solana.com/) blockchain. You can use it to build Solana apps in NodeJS, web
browsers, React Native, and just about any other JavaScript environment.

Gill is built on top of the Solana JavaScript libraries built by Anza:
[@solana/kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit) (formerly known as "web3.js v2"). By utilizing the
same types and functions under the hood, `gill` is compatible with `@solana/kit`. All `@solana/kit`
imports can even be directly replaced with `gill` for one-to-one compatibility, plus unlocking the
various quality-of-life improvements that gill provides.

## Quick start

Follow these simple steps to install and get started with the `gill` library:

<Steps>
<Step>
 
### Install gill

Install the core `gill` library in your project:

```package-install
gill
```

<Callout title="Coming from Kit?">
  All imports from the `@solana/kit` library can be directly replaces with `gill` to achieve the
  exact same functionality. Plus unlock the additional functionality only included in gill, like
  `createTransaction`.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a Solana RPC connection

Create a Solana `rpc` and `rpcSubscriptions` client connection from any RPC URL or standard Solana
network moniker (i.e. `devnet`, `localnet`, `mainnet` etc).

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "mainnet",
});
```

The above snippet demonstrates how to use the public Solana RPC endpoints. These are great for quick
local testing, but they are (rightfully) subject to heavy rate limits.

When you are ready to ship your application to production, you will need to utilize a production
ready RPC provider.

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "https://private-solana-rpc-provider.com",
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Make Solana RPC requests

After you have a Solana `rpc` connection, you can make all the
[JSON RPC method](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) calls directly off of it.

```typescript
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

// get slot
const slot = await rpc.getSlot().send();

// get the latest blockhash
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

<Callout>
  The `rpc` client requires you to call `.send()` on the RPC method in order to actually send the
  request to your RPC provider and get a response.
</Callout>

</Step>
