description:
  "Understand how to use gill's debug mode to more easily debug your Solana applications."
---

Within `gill`, you can enable "debug mode" to automatically log additional information that will be
helpful in troubleshooting your Solana applications (especially failing transactions).

[Debug mode](./debug-mode) is disabled by default to minimize additional logs for your application.
But with its flexible debug controller, you can enable it from the most common places your code will
be run. Including your code itself, NodeJS backends, serverless functions, and even the in web
browser console itself.

Some examples of the existing debug logs that `gill` has sprinkled in:

- log the Solana Explorer link for transactions as you are sending them via
  `sendAndConfirmTransaction`
- log the base64 transaction string for further troubleshooting using
  [`mucho inspect`](https://github.com/solana-developers/mucho?tab=readme-ov-file#inspect) or the
  Solana Explorer's [Transaction Inspector](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/inspector)

## How to enable debug mode

To enable debug mode, set any of the following to `true` or `1`:

- `process.env.GILL_DEBUG`
- `global.__GILL_DEBUG__`
- `window.__GILL_DEBUG__` (i.e. in your web browser's console)
- or manually set any debug log level (see below)

```ts
import { ... } from "gill"

/** Turn on debug mode */
global.__GILL_DEBUG__ = true;
```

  Set the `GILL_DEBUG` environment variable in your applications' preview/staging environments to
  improve your logging and troubleshooting workflows.
</Callout>

## How to set a debug level

To set a desired level of logs to be output in your application, set the value of one of the
following (default: `info`):

- `process.env.GILL_DEBUG_LEVEL`
- `global.__GILL_DEBUG_LEVEL__`
- `window.__GILL_DEBUG_LEVEL__` (i.e. in your web browser's console)

```ts
import { ... } from "gill"

/** Set the debug mode log level (default: `info`) */
global.__GILL_DEBUG_LEVEL__ = "debug";
```

The log levels supported (in order of priority):

1. `debug` (lowest)
2. `info` (default)
3. `warn`
4. `error`

## Custom debug logs

Gill also exports the same debug functions it uses internally, allowing you to implement your own
debug logic related to your Solana application and use the same controller for it as `gill` does.

These functions include:

- `isDebugEnabled()` - check if debug mode is enabled or not
- `debug()` - print debug message if the set log level is reached

```typescript
import { debug, isDebugEnabled } from "gill";

if (isDebugEnabled()) {
  // your custom logic
}

// log this message if the "info" or above log level is enabled
debug("custom message");

// log this message if the "debug" or above log level is enabled
debug("custom message", "debug");

// log this message if the "warn" or above log level is enabled
debug("custom message", "warn");

// log this message if the "warn" or above log level is enabled
debug("custom message", "warn");
```
