title: Create a Solana client
description: Create a client connection to the Solana blockchain to perform Solana RPC requests.
---

Setting up a client connection to the Solana blockchain is a very important part of your
application. This client connection is how your application will be sending and receiving data from
the Solana JSON RPC layer, including [fetching accounts](#fetch-an-account) and sending
transactions.

Gill considers the "Solana client" to be (at a minimum) the following pieces:

- `rpc` - used to interact with the your [Solana JSON RPC](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http)
  provider (typically via HTTP)
- `rpcSubscriptions` - used to interact with the Solana RPC over websockets
- `sendAndConfirmTransaction` - used to send and confirm a Solana transaction over the RPC
  connections

<Callout>
  If you are familiar with the `Connection` class from the older `@solana/web3.js` library, gill's
  `createSolanaClient` is similar. But more bare-bones and lightweight.
</Callout>

Most client applications will need to initialize the above functionality in their codebase. Within
gill, there are two primary ways to create a Solana client:

1. using the [`createSolanaClient()`](#create-a-solana-rpc-connection) function (recommended in
   order to reduce application boilerplate)
2. manually initialize them all individually

## Create a Solana RPC connection

Create the Solana client connections (i.e. `rpc` and `rpcSubscriptions`) from any RPC URL or
standard Solana network moniker (i.e. `devnet`, `localnet`, `mainnet` etc) using the
`createSolanaClient()` function.

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "mainnet",
});
```

Using the Solana moniker will connect to the public RPC endpoints. These are subject to rate limits
and should not be used in production applications. Applications should find their own RPC provider
and use the URL provided by them.

### Solana client for localnet

Developers can also connect to a local test validator (like
[`solana-test-validator`](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#run-local-validator)) running
on your computer.

To create a Solana client for your local test validator:

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "localnet",
});
```

<Callout>
  The `urlOrMoniker` value of `localnet` will utilize the default test validator address and port of
  `http://127.0.0.1:8899`. If you need to connect to a different address/port, then simply pass in
  its entire URL. See [custom RPC URL](#solana-client-for-a-custom-rpc-url) below.
</Callout>

### Solana client for a custom RPC URL

To create an RPC client for an custom RPC provider or service:

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient({
  urlOrMoniker: "https://private-solana-rpc-provider.com",
});
```

## Making Solana RPC calls

After you have a Solana `rpc` connection, you can make all the
[JSON RPC method](https://solana.com/docs/rpc) calls directly off of it. Most commonly to get the
[latest blockhash](#get-the-latest-blockhash) or [fetching a specific account](#fetch-an-account).

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

// get slot
const slot = await rpc.getSlot().send();

// get the latest blockhash
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

The `rpc` client requires you to call `.send()` on the RPC method in order to actually send the
request to your RPC provider and get a response.

#### Destructure and renaming response values

Many of the Solana RPC responses will return a generic `value` attribute containing the typed
response payload. It is a common practice to
[destructure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring)
this generic `value` into a more aptly named variable, such as `latestBlockhash` (as demonstrated in
the example below).

### Get the latest blockhash

On Solana, the latest blockhash is uses as a sort of "recent timestamp" check within the
transaction.

To get the latest blockhash from your RPC:

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

// get the latest blockhash
const { value: latestBlockhash } = await rpc.getLatestBlockhash().send();
```

<Callout title="Pro tip">
  Only request this value *just before* you are going to use it your code. Since latest blockhashes
  are only valid for approximately 1-2 minutes, requesting it at the latest possible time in your
  codebase can help improve transaction landing rates.
</Callout>

### Fetch an account

All the data stored on the Solana blockchain is stored in
[accounts](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts), including native SOL balance, tokens, and
programs. The structure of an account's data and associated metadata information is called an
`AccountInfo`.

To get an account's `AccountInfo` from your RPC:

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient, address } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

const accountToFetch = address("nick6zJc6HpW3kfBm4xS2dmbuVRyb5F3AnUvj5ymzR5");

// get the `AccountInfo` with (default) `base58` encoding for the data
const { value: accountInfo } = await rpc.getAccountInfo(accountToFetch).send();
```

<Callout title="" type="error">
  By default, the `getAccountInfo` RPC method will utilize the `base58` encoding for the `data`
  within the account itself. This is fine for accounts with small amounts of data stored in them,
  but fetching accounts with larger amounts of `data` will result in an error with the `base58`
  encoding.
</Callout>

It is **strongly** recommended to utilize `base64` encoding when fetching accounts from the
blockchain to avoid the common errors when fetching with the default `base58` encoding.

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient, address } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

const accountToFetch = address("nick6zJc6HpW3kfBm4xS2dmbuVRyb5F3AnUvj5ymzR5");

// get the `AccountInfo` with `base64` encoding for the data
const { value: accountInfo } = await rpc
  .getAccountInfo(accountToFetch, { encoding: "base64" })
  .send();
```

An even better solution is to utilize the `fetchEncodedAccount()` function to fetch accounts, which
always utilizes the `base64` encoding.

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient, address, fetchEncodedAccount } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

const accountToFetch = address("nick6zJc6HpW3kfBm4xS2dmbuVRyb5F3AnUvj5ymzR5");

const account = await fetchEncodedAccount(rpc, accountToFetch);
```

These encoded accounts can then easily be decoded by the correct `Decoder` for the structure of the
account's `data`.

### Using AbortControllers

You can also include custom configuration settings on your RPC calls, like using a JavaScript
[AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController), by passing them
into `send()`:

```typescript twoslash
import { createSolanaClient } from "gill";

const { rpc } = createSolanaClient({ urlOrMoniker: "devnet" });

// Create a new AbortController.
const abortController = new AbortController();

// Abort the request when the user navigates away from the current page.
function onUserNavigateAway() {
  abortController.abort();
}

// The request will be aborted if and only if the user navigates away from the page.
const slot = await rpc.getSlot().send({ abortSignal: abortController.signal });
```
