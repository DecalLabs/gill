title: Generate a signer
description: Create a new keypair signer that can perform Solana signing operations.
---

For most typical Solana transaction signing operations, you will be utilizing a `TransactionSigner`.
This object type is capable of being "attached" to instructions and transaction to perform signing
operations.

The most common of which is a `KeyPairSigner`, which is able to be passed around to the various
functions within gill to satisfies any `TransactionSigner` type requirements, like when building
instructions or creating transactions.

<Callout>
  Unless otherwise specifically noted in the gill documentation, the term "signer" refers to
  `TransactionSigner` and usually a `KeyPairSigner`.

## Generating a keypair signer

For various Solana development tasks, you may need to generate a new signer. Including when creating
a new account, generating reference keys for transactions, or
[creating tokens](/docs/guides/tokens/create-token).

The `generateKeyPairSigner()` function allows you to generate a new random `KeyPairSigner` (which
satisfies the `TransactionSigner` type) to perform signing operations.

```typescript twoslash
import { generateKeyPairSigner, type KeyPairSigner } from "gill";

const signer = await generateKeyPairSigner();
```

### Non-extractable by default

Under the hood, a `KeyPairSigner` utilize the
[Web Crypto APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to improve
security.

These signers are non-extractable by default; meaning there is no way to get the secret key material
out of the instance. This is a more secure practice and highly recommended to be used over
extractable keypairs, unless you REALLY need to be able to save the keypair for some reason.

## Generating extractable keypairs and signers

Extractable keypairs are less secure and should not be used unless you REALLY need to save the key
for some reason. Since there are a few useful cases for saving these keypairs, gill contains a
separate explicit function to generate these extractable keypairs.

To generate a random, **extractable** `KeyPairSigner`:

```typescript twoslash
import { generateExtractableKeyPairSigner } from "gill";

const signer = await generateExtractableKeyPairSigner();
```

<Callout title="WARNING" type="error">
  Using **extractable** keypairs are inherently less-secure, since they allow the secret key
  material to be extracted. Obviously. As such, they should only be used sparingly and ONLY when you
  have an explicit reason you need extract the key material (like if you are going to save the key
  to a file or environment variable).
