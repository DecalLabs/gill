## Install gill

Install gill using the core `gill` library:

```package-install
gill
```

## Importing from gill

The `gill` library has a few different import paths to help segment the code within library and
improve compatibility in different environments (i.e. browser vs server).

To utilize the core functionality in either browser or server environments, you can import directly
from `gill` as expected:

```ts
import { ... } from "gill"
```

### Import program clients

The `gill` package includes several Solana program clients including Token/Token22, System, Compute
Budget, and several others. The available program clients can be imported from the `gill/programs`
path as follows:

```ts
import { ... } from "gill/programs"
```

### Import server only utilities

The `gill` package includes some "server only" functionality that is only usable in JavaScript
server runtimes like NodeJs and Bun. To utilize this specific functionality, you can import from
`gill/node` as follows:

```ts
import { ... } from "gill/node"
```
